These are some python 3 tools I wrote to help manage stuff related to running MTG Vintage Rotisserie drafts, as well as
calculating statistics for them.

They all require scryfall-default-cards.json to be placed in the input/ folder. Get the latest Default Cards from
https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data and rename it to scryfall-default-cards.json

If a card picked in a VRD is later banned in vintage, the name of that card should be put in cards-later-banned-in-vintage.txt

The "compute" tools are made to be used with my spreadsheet at 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LKNtBof-FTxO6Zyzrv8MN-2AEexw5aHV_YnlwD46WM/edit#gid=997264821

The input file drafts.tsv should be generated by copying all rows from 102 downward from the "Raw Material For Stats" tab.

The output files "card stats.tsv" and "seat stats.tsv" are to be pasted into the "Card Stats" and
"Seat Stats" tabs.
